        This website is like a portfolio to present some projects that I have done.
        So it is mostly direct toward employers.

        All the source code for this website and other achivements 
        are available on my github account.

        A version of my resume is available on the following link:

                    This application find similarities and gaps between two sequences of character. 
                    It is used usually in Bioinformatics to compare DNA or protein sequences. 
                    I design the algorithm myself, based on publications about local and global 
                    alignment (Needlman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithm).<br><br>

                    This application is a web adaptation of a project that I realized during one of my classes. 
                    It is written in Javascript and use a library from Duke university for images management.<br><br>

                    This is a machine learning application for which I have trained 
                    separately a Support Vector Machine Classifier with the MNIST 
                    dataset of handwritten digits. Before processing, an image is transformed by Principal Component Analysis. The classifier then is able to predict a new digit written by a human.<br>
