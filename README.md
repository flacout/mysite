# My Website
http://fabricelacout.pythonanywhere.com/

This is an exhibition website to showcase my work.

There is 3 applications to test:
+ A DNA sequence alignment program
+ A machine learning program
+ A photo manager program

An account was also made available to play around. Login with ID `bill` password `bill` to use it.

The only tests available at this hour are for the DNA sequence alignment in the `/align/tests.py` file.

The classifier for the machine learning program, was trained separately with the script `/ml/classifier.py` the resulting parameters are then saved and used for the website deployment.

## Local Installation
The application uses `python3` `django` and `sqlite`.

The other library to install are: `numpy` `scikit-learn` `pandas` `scipy` `Pillow` (PIL)
